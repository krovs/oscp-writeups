This is my collection of writeups from my journey preparing for both the **eCPPTv3** and **OSCP** certifications. I tackled a wide range of machines and challenges, following [Lainkusanagi's guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18weuz_Eeynr6sXFQ87Cd5F0slOj9Z6rt/edit?pli=1&gid=487240997#gid=487240997) across **HackTheBox**, **TryHackMe**, and **Proving Grounds**. I also dove into Active Directory labs from **HackTheBox Academy**. 🖥️🔍

Here you'll find step-by-step walkthroughs and techniques I picked up along the way. If you're looking for my study notes and a list of all the resources I used, check out my other repository -> [OSCP Notes](https://github.com/krovs/oscp-notes)! 📚💻
